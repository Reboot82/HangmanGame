# Project-1

## Overview

For Project 1, I created a simple game of Hangman.

Once players come to the site, they are asked to click New Game to begin playing. The player starts by clicking on a letter from the letter bank. If the letter is in the word, it appears in the correct location at the bottom of the screen. If not, a portion of the hangman appears. They then continue guessing letters until either the player has discovered the word, or the entire hangman is revealed. Once a player wins, their score increases. If they lose, they lose one of their lives. After the player has run out of lives, their final score is shown on screen.
